Repository with the code for my solutions of the [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) contest.

The goal of this repository is to upgrade my skills in programming and contribute to the Advent of Code community with (maybe) some original ideas.


## Advent of Code?

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Advent of Code is an annual online event that takes place during the month of December :christmas_tree:. It's a series of daily programming challenges that typically involve solving algorithmic or coding problems. These challenges are designed to be fun and educational, covering a wide range of topics from basic algorithms to more advanced problems in data structures and mathematics. :rocket:

Each day includes two problems, where solving the first unlocks the second. Completing both problems earns you two stars per day, allowing participants to collect up to 50 stars :star: each year.

## The Code

It's written with as many comments and readability as possible.

:warning: However, it may:

 - Contain errors.
 - Not be efficient in terms of time/memory.
 - Be unreadable.
 - Lacking in documentation (comments may be in Spanish).

## Inputs :page_facing_up:

 The inputs are passed to the program as standard input or the program directly opens the file.
 
 The input of my problems are each in their respective folder :file_folder:. However programs must work for every input.
