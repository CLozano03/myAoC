### Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual online event that takes place during the month of December. It's a series of daily programming challenges that typically involve solving algorithmic or coding problems. These challenges are designed to be fun and educational, covering a wide range of topics from basic algorithms to more advanced problems in data structures and mathematics.
